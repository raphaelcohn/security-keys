# Installs a PKCS#11 driver and PKCS#15 file system support.

# See <https://github.com/OpenSC/OpenSC/wiki/macOS-Quick-Start>
#
# Config is stored at /Library/OpenSC/etc/opensc.conf
# PKCS#11 driver is stored at /usr/local/lib/opensc-pkcs11.so and /Library/OpenSC/lib/opensc-pkcs11.so (?Why?)
# A second PKCS#11 driver is stored at /Library/OpenSC/lib/onepin-opensc-pkcs11.so (but NOT in /usr/local/lib)!
#
# Should be called PIV_II, but seems to be absent from Keychain Access.
#
# Supports many smart card variants, but the two most of interest to us:-
#
# * PIV-II (Personal Identity Verification Card)
# * openpgp
#
# It seems a PIV-II card used by OpenSC DOES NOT support RSA 4096 but only RSA 3072.
